    <p><i>Trumon in film was living in a well-defined world, To break the setting rules and pursue our dream is not easy. So do Trumon guitars,we are always pursuing our ideal guitar. We are standing on the shoulders of giants and exploring the possibilities of every advancement in the guitar. No many conventions, not be limited to certain standards, whether the workmanships selections,acoustic explorations or appearance designs. Behind it, we have pondered for thousands of times. Although the process is not easy, whenever someone plays the Trumon guitar with their initial heart-beating for music, this is our greatest source of achievement. Because our work was integrated into people's emotions and stories, we are quite clear that when we do it like this, there's no way to cater to everyone and doomed not to be understood, we are not strangers for this, just as people playing their favorite musicï¼Œ we are making our favorite guitar. After all, Make a surprise.</i></p>
    <p><i>The moving works often from real stories and emotions,under the touch of the feeling, the sound has vitality ,just like the dolphin in the sea with the feeling of freedom and spirituality. We always hope that our guitar can resonate with that sound, to pour out one's hometown in the midst of human fireworks,to sing for a lifetime for those who pass by, for the past, for the future, for the present, for all things worth leaving traces, make your own voice heard.</i></p>
